<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Paolo Prem, this is my website and I will spend just few words about myself. My passion about computers and IT in general started very early, with the few video games I had and I could play on my potato computer, which I built myself. It was made of all the stuff my father could bring me home, motherboards, RAMs, hard disks, GPUs and so on, all parts that someone was throwing away. I remember the excitement when my father was bringing me a new piece of hardware, hoping it was somehow better than the ones I had currently installed.</p>
<p>This site is under development, as well as this page!</p>
<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
<p>I like music, all kind of music literally: I range from the most peaceful composition of classical music to the most brutal song of death metal. But my favorite artist is Frank Zappa, one of the greatest composer of the last century (in my humble opinion). Don&rsquo;t know him? Go listen to <em>Uncle Meat</em>, you&rsquo;ll probably don&rsquo;t like it but I love that album. I also play the guitar.<br>
Play videogames<br>
Read books</p>
