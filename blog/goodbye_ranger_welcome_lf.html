	<h1>Goodbye Ranger, Welcome lf!</h1>

	<p>
	When I first saw <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">Ranger</a>, I immediately loved it. You can manage your files entirely
	from your command line in an awesome way. Here is a screenshot taken from their official
	repository:

	Its biggest flaw? Python!
	</p>

	<p>
	I started using it instead of the `cd` command to navigate through my filesystem and I noticed an incredibly annoying 1/2 seconds delay before its interface appears on my terminal. This is the reason I started to look for some faster alternatives. I tried <a href="https://github.com/vifm/vifm">vifm</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jarun/nnn">nnn</a> but then I found <a href="https://github.com/gokcehan/lf">lf</a>, a file manager written in go. Not only it is faster than ranger, but it also looks very similar. Here is a screenshot taken from their official repository:

	<p>
	By default, when you close lf with the *q* key, it doesn't exit in the directory
	currently highlighted by lf but it returns to the one where you ran it. Since I am
	using it to navigate into my filesystem, I searched in their documentation how to
	achieve such goal. They provide a snippet of code that keeps track of the current
	directory and automatically `cd` into that. Here is the snippet:
	</p>

	<xmp>
lfcd () {
  tmp="$(mktemp)"
  /bin/lf -last-dir-path="$tmp" "$@"
  if [ -f "$tmp" ]; then
      dir="$(cat "$tmp")"
      rm -f "$tmp"
      if [ -d "$dir" ]; then
          if [ "$dir" != "$(pwd)" ]; then
              cd "$dir"
          fi
      fi
  fi
}
	</xmp>

	</p>
	Therefore, I created a new file, called *lfcd* and I sourced it in my `.zshrc`
	file (if you use bash, source it in you `.bashrc` file):
	</p>

	<xmp>
source "/path/to/my/lfcd/file/lfcd.sh"
	</xmp>
