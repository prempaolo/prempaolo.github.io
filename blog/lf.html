	<h1>Lf, the perfect terminal file manager</h1>
	<p>
	When I first saw <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">Ranger</a>, I immediately loved it. You can manage your files entirely
	from your command line in an awesome way. Here is a screenshot of its interface:

	Its biggest flaw? Python!
	</p>
	<p>
		I started using it instead of the <code>cd</code> command to navigate through my filesystem and I noticed an incredibly annoying delay of 1/2 seconds before I could use it. This is the reason I started to look for some faster alternatives. I tried <a href="https://github.com/vifm/vifm">vifm</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jarun/nnn">nnn</a> but then I found <a href="https://github.com/gokcehan/lf">lf</a>, a file manager written in go. Not only it is faster than ranger, but it also looks very similar. Here is a screenshot of its interface:

	<p>
		By default, when you close lf with the <i>q</i> key, it doesn't exit in the current directory, but it returns to the one where you ran it. Since I am	using it to navigate into my filesystem, I searched in their documentation how to	add this functionality. They provide a snippet of code that keeps track of the current directory and automatically <code>cd</code> into that. Here is the snippet:
	</p>
	<xmp>
lfcd () {
  tmp="$(mktemp)"
  /bin/lf -last-dir-path="$tmp" "$@"
  if [ -f "$tmp" ]; then
      dir="$(cat "$tmp")"
      rm -f "$tmp"
      if [ -d "$dir" ]; then
          if [ "$dir" != "$(pwd)" ]; then
              cd "$dir"
          fi
      fi
  fi
}
	</xmp>
	</p>
		Therefore, I created a new file, called <i>lfcd</i> and I sourced it in my <code>.zshrc</code> (if you use bash, source it in you <code>.bashrc</code>):
	</p>
	<xmp>
source "/path/to/my/lfcd/file/lfcd.sh"
	</xmp>
	<p>
		In this way I was able to navigate my filesystem only using lf. Nice! So, I was thinking, is there something that I can do with a GUI file manager that I cannot do with my current configuration of lf? And two things came to my mind:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Drag and drop</li>
		<li>Manage pictures and photos</li>
	</ul>
	<p>For the first thing I did a quick search on Google and found an awesome project called <a href="https://github.com/mwh/dragon">dragon drag and drop</a> that could create from the command line a simple window with the selected file/s to drag and drop. I immediately downloaded it and imlemented it into my configuration of lf adding the following snippet of code to the lfrc config file:
	</p>
	<xmp>
# Open drag and drop with t
map t $dragon-drag-and-drop -a -x $fx &
	</xmp>
	<p>
		In this way, using the <i>t</i> key, I can create a window with all the selected files and easily drag and drop them into any applications that support this functionality.<br>
		For the other task, i.e. managing photos and pictures, I thought at first that the most effective way to do that was to implement any sort of image preview within the terminal and within lf. Fortunately, I was wrong, the most simple and effective way was to use a program called <a href="https://github.com/muennich/sxiv">sxiv</a>. It's a simple image previewer that has a lot of potential, including custom scripts to execute on certain key combination. Maybe I will write another article only about that, for the moment I would just stick with the configuration with lf starting with an example.<br>
		It's annoying when I navigate into the folder of pictures created with my phone using lf, their names don't mean anything beside the date and time in which the photo was taken and no preview is possible. My first approach was closing lf, opening sxiv with all the pictures in the target folder, chose the one I wanted to edit/move and then copy the name to perform the desired action. This operation was much simpler using a GUI file manager. I informed myself on both lf and sxiv and after some tries I found the perfect combination, and this was achieved by adding the following line to my <code>lfrc</code>:
	</p>
	<xmp>
# Open all images in current folder in sxiv and select marked image
map L $lf -remote "send $id select '$(sxiv -o .*)'"
	</xmp>
	<p>
		Let's start with the first command executed, i.e. <code>sxiv -o .*</code>. This command simply opens sxiv with the <code>-o</code> option in the current folder with all the files it is able to process. The specified option is used to <i>"write list of all marked files to standard output when quitting"</i>, as also mentioned in its man page. When using sxiv, you can mark an image by simply pressing the <i>m</i> key. In this way I can mark the desired image I want to process, quit sxiv and I have its name printed in the standard output. The name is then processed by the second command <code>lf -remote "send $id select 'name-of-marked-file'"</code>. Lf has a running server in the background and differentiates the different instances using ids. With the previous command we are telling the server (using the <code>lf -remote</code>) to make the instance identified by <code>$id</code> to select the file corresponding by the last string. By default, every instance of lf has its id stored into the <code>$id</code> variable, accessible only inside the <code>lfrc</code> configuration file.<br>
	TL;DR In this way I can open sxiv with all the images in a folder by pressing <i>L</i> inside lf and then selecting on lf the marked image when quitting sxiv.
