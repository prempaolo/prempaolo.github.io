	<h1>XXE, is it possible to automate?</h1>
	<p>
		In this series I want to analyze the most simple Portswigger excercises for the XXE injection vulnerability (link <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe">here</a>) and try to think, while going through them, if the check for this vulnerability can be automated via a simple Python script. The idea is to start with a very basic version of the script that searches for the most simple XXE injection case and then refactor the script and modify it to work for new and more complex cases.

	<h2>What is a XXE (XML external entity injection) vulnerability?</h2>
	<p>
		TODO
	</p>
	<h2>Exercise 1: let's automate it to retrieve files!</h2>
	<p>
		The first thing to search for are POST forms. We can try then to make a POST request with our custom payload to check for the presence of a XXE vulnerability.
