      <description>When I first saw Ranger, I immediately loved it. You can manage your files entirely from your command line in an awesome way. Here is a screenshot taken from their official repository:
Its biggest flaw? Python!
I started using it instead of the cd command to navigate through my filesystem and I noticed an incredibly annoying 1/2 seconds delay before its interface appears on my terminal. This is the reason I started to look for some faster alternatives.</description>

      <description>This is a list of all my favorite albums of all time. It is not supposed to have an order, I will simply put a new album if I think that album is one of the greatest album ever done (of those I listened to so far).
WARNING: this site is currently under development as well as the content of this page!
Uncle Meat - Frank Zappa Absolutely my favorite Zappa album.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Paolo Prem, this is my website and I will spend just few words about myself. My passion about computers and IT in general started very early, with the few video games I had and I could play on my potato computer, which I built myself. It was made of all the stuff my father could bring me home, motherboards, RAMs, hard disks, GPUs and so on, all parts that someone was throwing away.</description>
